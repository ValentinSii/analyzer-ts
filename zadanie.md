Web scraping is a technique used to automatically extract data from the internet. This data can then be further used for a variety of applications in data and market analysis. Data is typically distributed across the whole web page, residing in multiple sources such as HTML of website, JSON-LD data, schema.org data etc. The problem is that not all data can be extracted immediately from the HTML after the first loading of the website, as some data is loaded dynamically after using different types of requests. One way to perform these requests is to use tools like Playwright or Puppeteer which use a lot of resources. The goal is to replicate those requests using a plain HTTP client.

The student will study the necessary literature for working with browsers, web automation and currently used techniques for data extraction. He will create software that will analyze a given web page, locate desired data in the communication between the client and the server and guide users on how to extract them automatically and effectively.
